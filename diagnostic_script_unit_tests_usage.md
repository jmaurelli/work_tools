How to Use:

Save: Save the code above as test_linux_diagnostic_script.sh.
Original Script: Ensure linux_diagnostic_script.sh is in the same directory (or update SCRIPT_UNDER_TEST).
shunit2: Ensure shunit2 is available (download and place as ./shunit2 or have it in your PATH). The test script now includes a basic check for it.
Make Executable: chmod +x test_linux_diagnostic_script.sh
Run: ./test_linux_diagnostic_script.sh
Explanation of New Tests:

collect_files Tests:
These tests create dummy files (touch) within the temporary test directory ($SHUNIT_TMPDIR) managed by setUp and tearDown.
They call collect_files with different combinations of existing and non-existing file paths.
They capture the standard output (output=$(...)) of the function.
Assertions check the function's return status ($?) and use assertContains / assertNotContains / assertNull to verify that the expected warning messages (or lack thereof) are printed to standard output.

generate_report Test:
Mocking: This is key. The activate_mocks function does the following:
Creates mock shell functions (mock_date, mock_hostname, etc.) that just echo predictable strings.
Creates a temporary mock_bin directory.
Writes small wrapper scripts into mock_bin (e.g., a script named date that calls mock_date).
Makes these wrapper scripts executable.
Crucially, it prepends $SHUNIT_TMPDIR/mock_bin to the PATH environment variable. This ensures that when generate_report calls date, hostname, etc., it executes our mock wrapper scripts instead of the real system commands.
Execution: It calls generate_report with a test file name.

Assertions:
Checks if the report file was created (assertTrue "[ -f ... ]").
Checks the standard output of generate_report itself for the start/end messages.
Reads the content of the generated report file (cat "$report_file").
Uses assertContains to verify that the report includes both the static headers (like --- Uptime ---) and the specific output strings generated by our mock functions.
tearDown: Restores the original PATH to avoid affecting subsequent tests or the shell environment after the tests finish.
These tests cover the logic within collect_files and generate_report in isolation, verifying their behavior based on inputs and (for generate_report) mocked dependencies.
